## Abstract
In user-centric design, persona development is crucial for understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, identifying key audience segments, and supporting decision-making. However, the complexity of today's user interactions reinforces the need for a contextualized approach to align designs closely with actual user needs. Previous studies have enhanced persona classification's ability to understand user behaviours; yet, its struggle to capture contextual information by combining textual and tabular data remains a significant challenge. Additionally, these models struggle with explainability, making their interpretability and the justification of their predictions largely unexplored. To address this, in this study, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBand), a hybrid (text-tabular) approach that leverages transformers to effectively model contextual features for persona classification. Specifically, ExBigBang integrates a text-tabular transformer model to incorporate contextual information from metadata, domain knowledge and user profiling. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and persona classification, it dynamically ensures a continuously updated reflection of user behaviours. Our experiments validate our model's robustness on a benchmark persona classification dataset. The ablation study highlights the impact of integrating textual and tabular data through our transformer-based model, while our application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques elucidates the reasons behind its predictions in persona classification.
